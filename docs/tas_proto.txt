TAS server protocol
===================

Connect to a TCP socket on localhost:6555.

Every packet consists of a one-byte (u8) ID, followed by some extra data. the extra data is specified here under the packet name; if there's nothing specified, there's no extra data.

The server should always send a packet with ID 255 first; it'll never send this again.

server (SAR) -> client (VSC extension):
	[0] set active
		len1: u32
		filename1: [len1]u8  // relative to "Portal 2/tas/", so the same as the arg you'd give to sar_tas_play
		len2: u32            // 0 if SP TAS
		filename2: [len2]u8  // relative to "Portal 2/tas/", so the same as the arg you'd give to sar_tas_play

	[1] set inactive

	[2] update playback rate
		rate: f32
	
	[3] state = playing

	[4] state = paused

	[5] state = fast-forwarding

	[6] update current tick
		tick: u32

	[7] update debug tick
		tick: i32 // -1 if no debug tick

	[10] processed script (sent when protocol script finished playing)
		slot: u8
		len: u32
		script: [len]u8

	[100] entity info response
		state: u8 // if 0, the rest of the data is not sent
		position: [3]f32 // x,y,z of entity's position
		angles: [3]f32 // pitch, yaw and roll of entity's rotation
		velocity: [3]f32 // x,y,z of entity's velocity

	[255] set game location
		len: u32
		location: [len]u8  // a string like "/home/mlugg/.steam/steam/steamapps/common/Portal 2", used so that the plugin knows whether it has the right script folder open


client (VSC extension) -> server (SAR):
	[0] request playback
		len1: u32
		filename1: [len1]u8  // relative to "Portal 2/tas/", so the same as the arg you'd give to sar_tas_play
		len2: u32            // 0 if SP TAS
		filename2: [len2]u8  // relative to "Portal 2/tas/", so the same as the arg you'd give to sar_tas_play
	
	[1] stop playback
	
	[2] request playback rate change
		rate: f32
	
	[3] request state = playing

	[4] request state = paused

	[5] request state = fast-forwarding
		tick: u32
		pause_after: u8  // if 0, play after; otherwise, pause after
	
	[6] set next pause tick
		tick: u32  // if 0, disable next pause
	
	[7] advance tick (only valid when paused)
	
	[10] request playback (protocol script)
		len1: u32
		script1name: [len1]u8
		len2: u32
		script1: [len2]u8
		len3: u32            // 0 if SP TAS
		script2name: [len3]u8
		len4: u32            // 0 if SP TAS
		script2: [len4]u8

	[100] request entity info
		len: u32
		entity_selector: [len]u8
